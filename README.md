# bets
A mobile app for betting on football matches. There are 2 views in the app: one for making predictions on upcoming matches and the other for seeing the actual results compared to the predictions made in the previous view.

# features
- all matches are loaded from mock server (mocky.io) and stored in Room database
- the app always opens the last screen user was
- app has multi-module structure: navigation module for navigation, core module for base classes and methods, bets module as feature module and app module as main application.
- navigation architecture has opportunity to easily add new modules
- app won't make HTTP requests if it less than minute from the last request, it will load data from database instead
